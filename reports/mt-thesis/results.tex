\subsubsection*{Burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Europe}

The inferred epidemic trajectories contain the information about the total number of cases until 8th of March. For the European countries, we obtain an inferred number of total cases above the number of confirmed cases to ECDC, consistent with known limited test availability of the first wave and  previous studies results \cite{Li2020} \cite{Wu2020}. These cases counts correspond to \todo{Include values} x-y times higher than the number of reported cases. Italy is the country with the highest infered number of cases x, followed by Spain, France and Germany. The infered number of cases for China is below the reported number of cases. \todo{limitations of the model, sequence information, partial outbreak dynamics}\\

\end{figure}


In Figure \ref{fig:gribbon} and/or \ref{fig:trajs} we compare the total number of inferred cases by day to the total cumulative number of cases that have been reported to ECDC that same day. Our inferred case counts follow a exponential growth earlier in time than the reported curve and with higher number of cases, being the difference bigger for later times in the epidemic.\\

    \label{fig:reported}
\end{figure}

We can think of a reporting rate as the number of reported cases relative to the total number of cases inferred by the model. This reporting rate decreases with time for all European countries, except for Italy that increases again around March, Figure \ref{fig:reported}. 


\subsubsection*{First introductions into European countries}

From the set of random subsampled trajectories, the first introduction time for each epidemic trajectory is recorded and the probability distribution over all these times is plotted. \textbf{A} Probability density of the time of first introduction for each deme. Each dotted line represents the first date when cases where reported to ECDC by deme color. In the case of China, the distribution of the origin time is plotted, since in the analysis we defined Chine as the origin of the epidemic with probability 1. For the other five demes, the distribution of the time of first migration into the deme is shown. \textbf{B} Stacked probability density of the destination of first introduction into Europe coloured by the destination deme.

\end{figure}

We would like to answer the question of when and where the first case in Europe occured. We can look to the model inferred epidemic trajectories and analyze the time distribution of the first case in Europe and in each deme. China is defined as the origin of the epidemic in the analysis and this is reflected in Figure \ref{fig:first} A. The occurrence of the origin of the epidemic, i.e. first case in China, is almost one month before the epidemic starts in any European country, ranging \todo{Include values}  x-y. The inferred date of the first case in Europe is inferred to be between a 95\% interval x-y. Among the European countries, France and Germany have the earlier time of introduction, followed by Italy, Other European deme and Spain. We can compare this inferred dates of introduction with the day each country reported its first case to ECDC. In all cases, the reported day was later than the median of the inferred distribution, but it is inside the 95\% interval.\\

The first case in Europe for each trajectoy corresponds to a migration from China to any European country. We can analyze the destination of this first migration into Europe as is shown in Figure \ref{fig:first} B. According to our model, the probability that this first European case was in Spain is very low. The destination of the first case amonth the rest of European demes is equally probable and there is no clear difference in the time distribution for each destination country, with a maximum probability around x.\\
\todo{explain this better, compute the probability of the first case in Europe destination}

The first case in each European country could have been imported from China or from other European country with an ongoing epidemic that started earlier. However, in our analysis we obtain a much higher support for China being the most probable source of the first case for all European demes, Figure \ref{fig:first} C.\\

Even if the first case in each European country came from China, the timing of the introductions in the European countries relative to each other probablu expanded across several days, defining and order of countries with the time of their first case. 

We can analyze if this order of countries, defined by the time in which the first case occured, is shared among the majority of the inferred population trajectories, Figure \ref{fig:first_imig}. We obtain that the first European country with a SARS-CoV-2 case was more likely France or Germany, followed by Italy and Other European deme. While Spain was more likely the last European country with a case among the ones included in the analysis.\\

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{201030_europe3_figtraj05.png}
    \caption{Countries ordered by the time of its first introduction, i.e. first case in the country. Each row is the order for one of the subsampled epidemic trajectories and each column represents the position relative to the other countries first introduction, e.g. in first position for all epidemic trajectories is China since it is the origin of the epidemic.} 
    \label{fig:first_imig}
\end{figure}

Along the same lines, we could ask if this order of countries is mantained when instead of looking at the first case in the country we look into at first case exported (migration) from that country to other European country. In Figure \ref{fig:first_omig} we observe a similar pattern to the first cases order, with Germany, France and Italy being the countries in the first positions in more than half of the inferred trajectories and never in the last position, and Spain as the country in last position in almost every epidemic trajectory.\\

\subsubsection*{Migration vs within-region transmission}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{201030_europe3_figtraj07.png}
    \caption{Median and 95\% credible interval for the cumulative number of events (within-region transmissions and migrations to the country (incoming) and from the country (outgoing) over time.}
    \label{fig:events}
    \todo[inline]{change legend outgoing migration}
\end{figure}


\todo[inline]{TODO}

From the epidemic trajectories, we can extract the information about how many cases are within-region transmission and how many are migrations from other countries. The cumulative number of transmission events and migrations, represented in Figure \ref{fig:events} increases exponentially over time. An incomming migration into every European deme happens always before within-region transmission, seeding the epidemic. Within-region transmision accounts for most of the cases in the countries from late january onwards (when first cases were being reported in Europe).

\todo{get the proportion of within-region transmission and incoming migrations?}

The time between the first case in the country, i.e. first incoming migration event and the first case from within-region transmission is of x  (y-z) with similar values for all demes?. The time from the first incoming migration to the first outgoing migration is longer with a median of x (y-z). (This could be interesting to say if we should focus or not the screening and testing capacities to detect incoming migrations or if when we have evidence of cases in the population we shoud follow a more general strategy to find cases in the population according to the model. Is it different for each country?)\\

(How well did the countries detecting the first cases, there were already within region transmision?) We compare the date of the first reported rate of each country with the date in which within-region transmission for that country started according to the model. We see some differences among countries, France and Germany had in all inferred epidemic trajectories ongoing within-region transmission when first cases werre reported, while x\% of epidemic trajectories did not have had a within region transmission case when the first case in Spain was reported.\\

We can also compare the date of the first reported case with the date of the first outgoing migration from the country. (This could be interesting to say if a extreme measure closing borders with the first case could be effective to impede transmission to other countries: percentage of trajectories whre transmission to Europe would have been avoided. For other countries we can look at how many migrations events could have been avoided (and how many not) if the country closed borders after first reported case according to the model. Not realistic measure, extreme case.)\\ 



\subsubsection*{Migrations patterns}
Figures \ref{fig:migs_srcdest} and \ref{fig:migs}.\\
\todo[inline]{TODO}

Similar information in both plots, but in the chord plots instead of a daily evolution the time period is split on three (as in the GLM analysis). Chord plots are nicer and easier to understand I think, but barplots shows the great detail of the results of the model. Another advantage of the chrod plot is that the it shows mean absolute values and not only relative values.\\

Hubei-China is the majority source of migrations for all countries till February and then some patterns emerge (we expect more interesting results with the added info in GLM analysis).\\
