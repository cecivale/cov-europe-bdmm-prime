# Alignments are partitioned into smaller groups to speed up the overall alignment process.
# The number of sequences per group determines the run time of a single alignment job.

# Mask settings determine how the multiple sequence alignment is masked prior to phylogenetic inference.
mask:
  # Number of bases to mask from the beginning and end of the alignment. These regions of the genome
  # are difficult to sequence accurately.

  # Specific sites to mask in the reference genome's coordinates.
  # These are 1-indexed coordinates of sites that have been identified as prone to sequencing errors.

# This is where we define which builds we'd like to run.

# Geography is specified by build attributes (e.g., `region`, `country`, `division`, `location`) that are referenced from subsampling schemes.

  # This build focuses on Europe samples
